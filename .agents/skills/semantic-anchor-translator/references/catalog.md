- **Also known as:** Three-Point Estimation, PERT Network Analysis
- **Proponents:** D.G. Malcolm, J.H. Roseboom, C.E. Clark, W. Fazar
- **Core:** Stochastic project scheduling using three-point estimates per activity (Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic); weighted average formula E = (O + 4M + P) / 6; standard deviation σ = (P − O) / 6; critical path analysis; probabilistic milestone confidence intervals

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Also known as:** MVP, Lean Startup MVP
- **Proponents:** Eric Ries, Frank Robinson
- **Core:** Smallest product that tests a single falsifiable hypothesis about user needs with the least effort; the defining output is *validated learning*, not a feature set or revenue; first turn of the build-measure-learn loop; distinct from a "small v1" — an MVP would be embarrassing to ship in production because its job is learning, not market entry; gives evidence for pivot-or-persevere decisions

### Hoshin Kanri
- **Also known as:** Policy Deployment, Strategy Deployment, Hoshin Planning
- **Proponents:** Yoji Akao ("Hoshin Kanri: Policy Deployment for Successful TQM", 1991), Thomas L. Jackson ("Hoshin Kanri for the Lean Enterprise", 2006)
- **Core:** Lean strategy-deployment discipline — 3-5 year True North breakthrough objectives cascade into annual hoshin via the X-Matrix (long-term strategy × annual objectives × improvement priorities × metrics, with explicit correlations); two-way *catchball* negotiation between levels prevents top-down imposition; monthly *Bowling Chart* reviews drive PDCA on the strategy itself; deliberately restricted to the few vital goals so "business as usual" stays outside the hoshin

### Decisional Balance Sheet
- **Also known as:** Benjamin Franklin Analysis, Moral Algebra, Pros-and-Cons Sheet
- **Proponents:** Irving Janis & Leon Mann ("Decision Making: A Psychological Analysis of Conflict, Choice, and Commitment", 1977); Benjamin Franklin (1772 "moral algebra" letter to Joseph Priestley); adapted by Miller & Rollnick ("Motivational Interviewing", 1991)
- **Core:** Four-cell decision matrix capturing utilitarian gains/losses for self and for significant others, plus self-approval and approval from others; weighted entries surface trade-offs and resolve ambivalence rather than mechanise the choice; simplified two-column pros/cons form is a degenerate case; used in decision coaching and Motivational Interviewing to elicit change-talk; deliberative — weak under time pressure or high uncertainty

## Creative Writing & Storytelling

### Three-Act Structure
- **Also known as:** Setup-Confrontation-Resolution, Beginning-Middle-End, Aristotelian Three-Act Structure
- **Proponents:** Aristotle, Syd Field, Robert McKee, Blake Snyder
- **Core:** Setup (introduce world + inciting incident, ~25%) → Confrontation (escalating obstacles + midpoint reversal + all-is-lost, ~50%) → Resolution (climax + denouement, ~25%); the foundational Western narrative scaffold

### Hero's Journey
- **Also known as:** Monomyth, Campbell's Monomyth, The Writer's Journey (Vogler)
- **Proponents:** Joseph Campbell, Christopher Vogler
- **Core:** 12-stage transformation arc: Ordinary World → Call to Adventure → Refusal → Mentor → Threshold → Tests → Ordeal → Reward → Road Back → Resurrection → Return with Elixir; universal mythic structure underlying most Western stories

### Save the Cat! (15-Beat Sheet)
- **Also known as:** Blake Snyder Beat Sheet, BS2
- **Proponents:** Blake Snyder
- **Core:** 15 precisely-timed beats for commercial screenplays: Opening Image → Theme Stated → Set-Up → Catalyst (p.12) → Debate → Break into Two (p.25) → B Story → Fun & Games → Midpoint (p.55) → Bad Guys Close In → All Is Lost (p.75) → Dark Night → Break into Three (p.85) → Finale → Final Image; audience-tested pacing formula

### Fichtean Curve
- **Also known as:** Rising Action Structure, Crisis-Driven Structure
- **Proponents:** John Gardner, Janet Burroway
- **Core:** Constant crisis — story begins in medias res, no traditional Act 1; a series of escalating mini-crises with no lulls; retrospective exposition woven in; climax followed by brief falling action; favoured for short fiction and fast-paced genre writing

### Freytag's Pyramid
- **Also known as:** Five-Act Structure, Dramatic Arc, Dramatic Pyramid
- **Proponents:** Gustav Freytag, John Yorke
- **Core:** Five acts: Exposition → Rising Action → Climax (midpoint) → Falling Action → Dénouement; models classical tragedy with hamartia (protagonist's fatal flaw); the structural ancestor of most dramatic analysis

### Story Circle (Dan Harmon)
- **Also known as:** Harmon Story Circle, Channel 101 Narrative Structure
- **Proponents:** Dan Harmon
- **Core:** 8-step circle derived from Campbell: You → Need → Go → Search → Find → Take → Return → Change; designed for episodic TV at any scale; the engine is the want-vs-need gap driving character transformation

### Kishōtenketsu
- **Also known as:** 起承転結, Four-Act Eastern Structure, Ki-Shō-Ten-Ketsu
- **Proponents:** Classical Chinese and Japanese narrative tradition, Tzvetan Todorov
- **Core:** Ki (introduce) → Shō (develop) → Ten (twist/recontextualise) → Ketsu (reconcile); no protagonist-antagonist conflict required; tension arises from juxtaposition and revelation; used in manga, haiku, and Nintendo game design
